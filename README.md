# Project: Rock Paper Scissors (Part I)
Reference: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors

## Purpose: 
* make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. 
* we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text
* You might notice some ‘Live Preview’ links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!


### Technologies: 
* JavaScript


### Tools
* Git
* GitHub


### Outcome
* I wrote a simple JavaScript program to take an input (rock, paper, or scissors), and output whether we won vs. a randomized computer result. 


### Links 
Codepen - solution link:

## Summary

### What I learned
* Function names are a verb. Keep concise and descriptive e.g. getS, calcE, createX, checkY. 
* One function - one action. Write a specific function for each specific purpose (segregrate). 
* Test each coding line before going onto the next e.g. (console.log)


### What could be improved
* To add in graphical user interface (Live Preview on GitHub pages)
* Need to figure out how to console.log the prompt input so that it performs 5 rounds in sequential order.
